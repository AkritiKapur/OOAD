### Assignment 2

This assignment is based on the same requirements as Assignment 1.
In the previous code, the sorting method was explicitly written but here we use in-built python method for sorting the shapes. This way we are able to reuse already written code and avoid bugs/ missing cases while rewriting.

Also, we do not override the displayshape method in each sub class as it was doing the same thing and was duplicated code.
